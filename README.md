# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to collect information on UFO sightings into a central website that is both easy to read and easy to filter. This will be accomplished using the following data and tools
 - Data is provided [here](https://github.com/dwright68/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
 - Javascript
 - Bootstrap CSS
 - An example of this webpage is hosted [here](https://dwright68.github.io/UFOs/)

### Filtering Data
To filter data on the webpage simply enter your criteria into one or more of the provided filter boxes. Once the boxes receive input, the page will update filters upon pressing enter or when going to the next text input box.

### Summary

One potentially major drawback is that there are no method to filter out criteria (eg: Having all states except CA display.) This can be futher improved by connecting this to a dynamically updated database of UFO sightings instead of a static collection that needs to be manually updated. Additionally some input cleaning within the table itself could go a long way to improve the overall readability and look of the website.
